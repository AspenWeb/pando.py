<p>Aspen can be configured with a project_root directory, a catchall for files
that don&rsquo;t belong in your actual URL hierarchy.  Think of it as your
site&rsquo;s junk drawer.</p>

<p>Previous versions of Aspen hard-wired this to a directory named
<code>.aspen</code> inside ${website.www_root}, but that was inflexible and
people struggled with hidden directories on Mac OS. Even earlier versions used
a cleverly-named __ directory as a virtualenv with a UNIX-y userland layout. So
conf files were under <code>etc/</code>, modules under
<code>lib/python/</code>, and templates under <code>etc/templates/</code>. For
reasons of versioning and deployment (most of which were first put into my head
by <a
    href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2007-March/002526.html">Jim
    Fulton</a>), it turns out to be better for <code>project_root</code> to be
flat.</p>

<h4>configuration files</h4>

<p>Aspen will read the following files from <code>project_root</code>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code><a href="/configure-aspen.py/">configure-aspen.py</a></code></li>
    <li><code><a href="/mime.types/">mime.types</a></code></li>
</ul>


<h4>Python modules</h4>

<p>The <code>project_root</code> directory is placed on <code>sys.path</code> during
startup, so you can place Python modules directly inside of this directory and
they will be available to your <a href="/hooks/">hooks</a> and <a
    href="/simplates/">simplates</a>.</p>

<p>This means that the <code>project_root</code> directory is a lightweight sandbox.
It is sufficient as such if Aspen itself is globally installed, and your site
doesn&rsquo;t need more than pure-Python modules. If you don&rsquo;t want to
install Aspen globally (and I don&rsquo;t blame you), or you have other Python
dependencies that have C extension modules, console scripts, or other things
that need to be run through distutils before being made accessible to you, then
you should use a full <a
    href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>. In this case
I&rsquo;ve had success using <code>project_root</code> itself as a virtualenv, though
you could also locate your virtualenv outside of your site tree.</p>


<h4>Template bases and includes</h4>

<p>The <a href="/templating/">template page</a> of simplates will look in
<code>project_root</code> for base templates for
<code>{&#37;&nbsp;extends&nbsp;%}</code> and file snippets for <code>{&#37;
    include %}</code>. You can specify relative paths there, so if you would
like to add a little structure to <code>project_root</code> here you can.</p>
