<p>Aspen simplates support content negotiation. If a file has no file
extension, then it can have multiple content pages, and the order they appear
in will determine their priority in <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html">HTTP content
    negotiation</a>.  If negotiation fails you&rsquo;ll get a <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.7">406
    Not Acceptable</a> response, with a prioritized list of available media
types. Joe Gregorio&rsquo;s <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/mimeparse/source/browse/trunk/mimeparse.py?r=22">content
    negotiation module</a> is vendored in to do the heavy lifting. The format
of the file is like this:</p>

<pre>import foo, json

&#94;L
data = foo.bar(request)

&#94;L #!pystache text/plain
{&#123; data }}

&#94;L application/json
{&#123; json.dumps(data) }}</pre>

<p>The first two pages of the file are logic pages. Both are required. After
that may appear an unlimited number of content pages. The first line of each
content page is the so-called &ldquo;specline,&rdquo; where you must specify
the media type of that content page. You may optionally specify <a
    href="/simplates/rendered/">a renderer</a> on the specline as well.</p>

<p>If a file <i>does</i> have a file extension, then it is a <a
    href="/simplates/rendered/">rendered simplate</a> with a media type
computed from the file extension. It is a SyntaxError for a file to have both
an extension and multiple content pages.</p>

<p>Files named &ldquo;index&rdquo; are included in resolving the default file
to use for a directory.</p>

<h3>Indirect Negotiation</h3>

<p>The canonical way to perform HTTP media type negotiation is with the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">Accept
    request header</a>. That&rsquo;s much more cumbersome than changing the
file extension in the URL, however, so Aspen supports both. If a request comes
in for <code>/foo.html</code> and there&rsquo;s no <code>foo.html</code> on the
filesystem but there <i>is</i> a <code>foo</code> file, then Aspen will serve
the request with that. If you request <code>foo.txt</code> but <code>foo</code>
doesn&rsquo;t include a text/plain page then you&rsquo;ll get a 404, whereas
with direct negotiation as above you would get a 406 with a list of available
media types.</p>
