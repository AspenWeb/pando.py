<p>Aspen can serve static files. If a file&rsquo;s file extension maps to
<code>text/*</code> or <code>application/json</code>, then the file is served
statically if there are no <a href="/page-break/">page breaks</a> in it. For
other media types it&rsquo;s a little more complicated, because a binary file
can have page breaks in it without being a simplate (I&rsquo;ve actually seen
this in the wild in a favicon, but I lost it). For binary files, Aspen looks
for a docstring or an import at the beginning of the file. Specifically, it
looks to see whether the file starts with &lsquo;"""&rsquo;,
&ldquo;import&rdquo; or &ldquo;from&rdquo;. The means that if you want to
dynamically serve PDFs, PNGs, etc., you have to make sure you start the file
with a docstring or an import.</p>
