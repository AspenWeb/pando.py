<p>&ldquo;I saw your <a
    href="http://blip.tv/pyohio/aspen-a-next-generation-web-framework-5436552">talk
    at PyOhio</a> this past summer. After the conference, I decided to give
Aspen a try firsthand, and I found it a pleasure to work with. I have since
converted my small business&rsquo;s website from a cluttered, obsolete Plone
installation to a very clean Aspen implementation.  The site is at <a
    href="http://approximatrix.com">http://approximatrix.com</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The site is almost entirely static with the exception of the News.
The goal was to show News from the site itself and also from a product&rsquo;s
site, which was available through an RSS feed. I was able to build an RSS feed
using Aspen pretty easily. Next, to get the news stories from two sites to
appear on the front page, I simply used the feedparser module to request the
news feed from the product&rsquo;s site and the site&rsquo;s own rss feed and
assemble the page, all via Aspen. Not particularly complicated, but it did
simplify creating and maintaining a simple small business home page.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I just wanted to share and thank you for the hard work on
Aspen. The whole framework was easy to use, especially for someone with
minimal web development experience like myself. I look forward to seeing and
hearing more about it!&rdquo;</p>
