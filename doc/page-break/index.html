<p>The <code>&#94;L</code> character is an <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_break">ASCII page break</a>, also
called:</p>

<ul>
    <li>form feed</li>
    <li>\f</li>
    <li>12</li>
    <li>0xC</li>
</ul>

<p>Aspen uses the ASCII page break to split <a href="/simplates/">simplates</a>
and <a href="/hooks/"><code>hooks.conf</code></a> into pages. The page break
character is a perfect fit semantically, and it is easy to type in Emacs and
Vim.</p>


<h4>Caret-L</h4>

<p>Since tool support is weak outside of Emacs and Vim, you can also use the
two characters "^" (caret) and "L" (uppercase ell).  Aspen will convert
caret-Ls to true page breaks when loading your simplates and
<code>hooks.conf</code>.  You can mix them interchangeably in the same
file.</p>

<p>To include a caret-L in the template portion of an HTML simplate, you can
use the escape sequence <code>&amp;#94;L</code>. That&rsquo;s how the caret-Ls
are included on this page, for example.</p>


<h3>Tool Support for True Page Breaks</h3>

<p>Page breaks are directly supported in Emacs and Vim. For other editors, you
may need to change your key bindings to use Ctrl-L for page breaks. Check
Wikipedia for a list of <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors#Key_bindings">editors
    with dynamic keybinding support</a>.</p>


<p>Ideally, one would be able to configure an editor to use different syntax
highlighting for different pages in a file. For Aspen simplates, one would want
the first two (optional) pages in a file to be Python, and the third to vary by
file extension. I don&rsquo;t know of any editor that currently supports
this.</p>

<p>Web browsers don&rsquo;t render page breaks, so it is better to use caret-L
any time you want to put a simplate code snippet on a website.</p>

<p>Below are some notes for specific editors.</p>


<h4>Emacs</h4>

<p>To enter a page break in Emacs, type <code>C-q C-l</code>. It renders as &#94;L.</p>

<p>Emacs actually provides for <a
    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Pages.html">navigating
    through a file based on page breaks</a>. I first discovered the page break
character in the email package in the standard library, which was written by
Barry Warsaw, an <a href="http://barry.warsaw.us/elisp/">Emacs user</a>.</p>

<p>This just in: apparently <a
    href="http://groups.google.com/group/aspen-users/browse_thread/thread/d48a39791cdca93f">Emacs
    can do multiple modes by page without too much trouble</a>.</p>


<h4>UltraEdit</h4>

<p>There is a &ldquo;Page Break&rdquo; option on the &ldquo;Insert&rdquo; menu.
You should remap Ctrl-L to that. By default, UltraEdit renders page breaks as a
nice thin line, though there is an option to render it as an ugly box.</p>


<h4>Vim</h4>

<p>Page breaks show up in Vim as &#94;L. You can enter one in insert mode
simply by typing <code>Ctrl-L</code>.</p>
