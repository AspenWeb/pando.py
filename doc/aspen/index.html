<p>You can serve Aspen websites with <a href="/deployment/">any WSGI
    server</a>, and Aspen also bundles a production-quality server of its own.
It&rsquo;s called ... <code>aspen</code>!</p>

<pre style="font-size: 10px;">Usage: aspen [options]

Aspen is a Python web framework. By default this program will start serving a
website from the current directory on port 8080. Options are as follows. See
also http://aspen.io/.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  Basic Options:
    -f CONFIGURATION_SCRIPTS, --configuration_scripts=CONFIGURATION_SCRIPTS
                        comma-separated list of paths to configuration files
                        in Python syntax to exec in addition to
                        $ASPEN_PROJECT_ROOT/configure-aspen.py
    -a NETWORK_ADDRESS, --network_address=NETWORK_ADDRESS
                        the IPv4, IPv6, or Unix address to bind to
                        [0.0.0.0:8080]
    -e NETWORK_ENGINE, --network_engine=NETWORK_ENGINE
                        the HTTP engine to use, one of {cheroot,cherrypy,diese
                        l,eventlet,gevent,pants,rocket,tornado,twisted}
                        [cherrypy]
    -q QUIET_LEVEL, --quiet_level=QUIET_LEVEL
                        a small integer; 1 will suppress most of aspen's
                        internal logging, 2 will suppress all it [0]
    -p PROJECT_ROOT, --project_root=PROJECT_ROOT
                        the filesystem path of the directory in which to look
                        for project files like template bases and such,
                        relative to $ASPEN_WWW_ROOT []
    -w WWW_ROOT, --www_root=WWW_ROOT
                        the filesystem path of the document publishing root
                        [.]

  Extended Options:
    I judge these variables to be less-often configured from the command
    line. But who knows?

    --changes_kill=CHANGES_KILL
                        if set to yes/true/1, changes to files in
                        $ASPEN_PROJECT_ROOT will cause aspen to exit [no]
    --charset_dynamic=CHARSET_DYNAMIC
                        this is set as the charset for template resources of
                        Content-Type text/* [UTF-8]
    --charset_static=CHARSET_STATIC
                        if set, this will be sent as the charset for static
                        resources of Content-Type text/*; if you want to punt
                        and let browsers guess, then just leave this unset []
    --indices=INDICES   a comma-separated list of filenames to look for when a
                        directory is requested directly; prefix with + to
                        extend previous configuration instead of overriding
                        [index.html, index.json]
    --list_directories=LIST_DIRECTORIES
                        if set to {yes,true,1}, aspen will serve a directory
                        listing when no index is available [no]
    --media_type_default=MEDIA_TYPE_DEFAULT
                        this is set as the Content-Type for resources of
                        otherwise unknown media type [text/plain]
    --media_type_json=MEDIA_TYPE_JSON
                        this is set as the Content-Type of JSON resources
                        [application/json]
    --show_tracebacks=SHOW_TRACEBACKS
                        if set to {yes,true,1}, 500s will have a traceback in
                        the browser [no]
