<p>The <code>aspen.Response</code> class has this constructor:</p>

<pre>def __init__(self, code=200, body='', headers=None):
    """Takes an int, a string, and a dict (or list of tuples).

        - code        an HTTP response code, e.g., 404
        - body        the message body as a string
        - headers     a Headers instance

    Code is first because when you're raising your own Responses, they're
    usually error conditions. Body is second because one more often wants
    to specify a body without headers, than a header without a body.

    """</pre>


<h4>The Default Response Object</h4>

<p>A <code>Response</code> object is automatically instantiated for all
requests.  This object is automatically available in the second page of your <a
    href="/simplates/">simplates</a>, where it is named <code>response</code>.
Likewise, it is passed as the only argument to your outbound <a
    href="/hooks/">hooks</a>.</p>

<p>One common thing to do with the <code>response</code> object is to set a
header. The <code>response.headers</code> attribute is the same as on <a
    href="/request/"><code>Request</code> objects</a>, so here&rsquo;s how you
would set a header in a simplate:</p>

<pre>response.headers['X-My-Header'] = 'Greetings, program!'
&#94;L
Check your headers.</pre>


<h4>Raising Responses</h4>

<p>You can also raise <code>Response</code> instances, because
<code>Response</code> is a subclass of Python's built-in <code>Exception</code>
class. This works in <a href="/hooks/">hooks</a>, and in <a
    href="/simplates/">simplates</a>, page two.</p>

<p>Make a simplate named <code>fishing.html</code> with this content:</p>

<pre>from aspen import Response
&#94;L
raise Response(200)
&#94;L
Let's go fishing!</pre>

{{ screenshot("fishing.200") }}

<p>Did you expect to see &ldquo;Let's go fishing!&rdquo; instead? The reason
you don&rsquo;t is that when you <code>raise Response()</code> from a simplate,
the template page of the simplate is skipped. This is because the feature is
really designed for <i>exceptions</i>, things like 404, etc.</p>

<p>So change the HTTP code in <code>fishing.html</code>:</p>

<pre>from aspen import Response
&#94;L
raise Response(404)
&#94;L
Let's go fishing!</pre>

<p>You will get this:</p>

{{ screenshot("fishing.404") }}


<h4>Custom Response Objects</h4>

<p>For advanced use cases, you can define your own <code>Response</code> class
and instantiate it inside of your simplates. Whatever is named
&ldquo;response&rdquo; at the end of page two of a simplate will be what Aspen
uses to capture the template output and respond to the client. That is, the
variable named &ldquo;response&rdquo; should be your <code>Response</code>
instance. It will be used as a response, and&mdash;unless you raise
it&mdash;its body attribute will be replaced with the output of the template
page.</p>
