"""Aspen uses resources to model HTTP resources.

Here is the class hierarchy:

    Resource                            Logic Pages     Content Pages
     +-- DynamicResource                -----------------------------
     |    +-- JSONResource                  1 or 2          0
     |    +-- NegotiatedResource            2               1 or more
     |    |    +-- RenderedResource         1 or 2          1
     |    +-- SocketResource                1, 2, or 3      0
     +-- StaticResource                     0               1


The call chain looks like this for static resources:

    StaticResource.respond(request, response)


It's more complicate for dynamic resources:

    DynamicResource.respond
        DynamicResource.parse
