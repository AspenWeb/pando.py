"""Aspen uses resources to model HTTP resources.

Here is the class hierarchy:

    Resource                            Logic Pages     Content Pages
     +-- DynamicResource                -----------------------------
     |    +-- JSONResource                  1 or 2          0
     |    +-- NegotiatedResource            1 or 2          1 or more
     |    |    +-- RenderedResource         1 or 2          1
     |    +-- SocketResource                1, 2, or 3      0
     +-- StaticResource                     0               1


The call chain looks like this for static resources:

    StaticResource.respond(request, response)


It's more complicate for dynamic resources:

    DynamicResource.respond
        DynamicResource.parse

    """Given raw file contents and a media type, return a Resource subclass.

    This function encodes the algorithm for deciding what kind of Resource a
    given file is. Is it a static file or a dynamic JSON resource or what? Etc.
    The first step is to decide whether it's static or dynamic:

        If media type is 'application/x-socket.io' then we know it's dynamic.

        If media type is 'text/*' or 'application/json' then we look for page
        breaks (^L). If there aren't any page breaks then it's a static file.
        If it has at least one page break then it's a dynamic resource.

        For all other media types we sniff the first few bytes of the file. If
        it looks Python-y then it's dynamic, otherwise it's a static file. What
        looks Python-y? Triple quotes for a leading docstring, or the beginning
        of an import statement ("from" or "import").

    Step two is to decide what kind of dynamic resource it is. JSON and Socket
    are based on media type. Otherwise it's Rendered if there is a file
    extension and Negotiated if not.
