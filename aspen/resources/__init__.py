        If mimetype is 'application/x-socket.io' then it's a Socket resource.

        If mimetype is 'text/*' or 'application/json' then we look for page
        breaks (^L). If there aren't any page breaks then it's a static file.
        If it has at least one page break then it's a dynamic resource (either
        Template or JSON).

        looks Python-y then it's a Template resource, otherwise it's a static
        file. What looks Python-y? Triple quotes for a leading docstring, or
