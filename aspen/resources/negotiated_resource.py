"""Negotiated resources

One not uncommon desire is to multiplex content types on a single HTTP
endpoint via content negotiation. Aspen should support this. Here's how
we want to do it.

If a file has no file extension, then it will be handled as a
"negotiated resource" ("simplate" is the file format, "resource" is the
thing defined by a simplate).

Negotiated resources should degrade such that a file is transparently
served as the first mime-type specified in the simplate

The format of the file is like this:

import foo
^L
data = foo.bar(request)
^L text/plain
{{ data }}
^L text/json
{{ json.dumps(data) }}

We have vendored in Joe Gregorio's content negotiation library ( http://code.google.com/p/mimeparse/source/browse/trunk/mimeparse.py ) to do the heavy lifting. This is in parallel to how we handle _cherrypy and _tornado vendoring.

This should also satisfy those who don't like inferring mimetypes from
file extensions. This would render as html:

/foo/bar

import foo
^L
hey = foo.bar(request)
^L text/html
<h1>{{ hey }}</h1>

Later:

If a file *does* have a file extension (foo.html), then it is a template
resource with a mimetype that matches the file extension

It is an error for a file to have both an extension *and* multiple template sections.

Given:

content 'single':

"global section"
import example
^L
"per-hit section"
data = "foo"
^L
{{ data }}


content 'multi':
"global section"
import example
^L
"per-hit section"
data = "foo"
^L text/plain
{{ data }}
^L text/html
HTML {{ data }}
^L application/json
{ 'json': '{{ data }}' }
