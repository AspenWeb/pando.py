"""These functions comprise the request processing functionality of Aspen.

Per the algorithm.py module, the functions defined in this present module are
executed in the order they're defined here, with dependencies injected as
specified in each function definition. Each function should return None, or a
dictionary that will be used to update the algorithm state in the calling
routine.

The naming convention we've adopted for the functions in this file is:

    verb_object_preposition_object-of-preposition

For example:

    parse_environ_into_request

All four parts are a single word each (there are exactly three underscores in
each function name). This convention is intended to make function names easy to
understand and remember.

It's important that function names remain relatively stable over time, as
downstream applications are expected to insert their own functions into this
algorithm based on the names of our functions here. A change in function names
or ordering here would constitute a backwards-incompatible change.
