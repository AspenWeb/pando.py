# Find a json module.
# ===================
# The standard library includes simplejson as json since 2.6, but without the
# C speedups. So we prefer simplejson if it is available.

# Allow arbitrary encoders to be registered.
# ==========================================
# One of the difficulties with JSON in Python is that pretty quickly one hits a
# class or type that needs extra work to decode to JSON. For example, support
# for the decimal.Decimal class was added in simplejson 2.1, which isn't in the
# stdlib version as of 2.7/3.2. Support for classes from the datetime module
# isn't in simplejson as of 2.3.2. Since Aspen takes on ownership of JSON
# encoding, we need to give Aspen users a way to register (and unregister, I
# guess) new encoders. You can do this by calling dumps with the cls keyword,
# but we call dumps for you for JSON resources, so we want a way to influence
# decoding that doesn't depend on dumps. And this is that way:

encoders = {}
def register_encoder(cls, encode):
    """Register the encode function for cls.

    An encoder should take an instance of cls and return something basically
    serializable (strings, lists, dictionaries).

    """
    encoders[cls] = encode

def unregister_encoder(cls):
    """Given a class, remove any encoder that has been registered for it.
    """
    if cls in encoders:
        del encoders[cls]

# http://docs.python.org/library/json.html
register_encoder(complex, lambda obj: [obj.real, obj.imag])

# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/455580/
register_encoder(datetime.datetime, lambda obj: obj.isoformat())
register_encoder(datetime.date, lambda obj: obj.isoformat())
register_encoder(datetime.time, lambda obj: obj.isoformat())


# Be lazy.
# ========
# Allow Aspen to run without JSON support. In practice that means that Python
# 2.5 users won't be able to use JSON resources.
